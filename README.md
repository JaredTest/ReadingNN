# ReadingNN

Hello

For Training: Google Cloud gives free limited credit to students.

ReadingNN Repo

A Machine Learning project designed to learn and recognize numbers from pictures and videos.

Welcome!

Things to Research:

Textbook: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

Tensorflow Similar Project: https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist.html

If any of you are unfamiliar with Python, you will need to research it. I would suggest Udemy's Complete Python Bootcamp ($11).

Neural Network Libraries

OpenCV

Flask

Python IDEs

Data Set: Possibly http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Interesting Article: https://medium.com/iotforall/tutorial-implement-object-recognition-on-live-stream-cc384f8556cc

I have a pretty good GPU that I am willing to offer depending on how we decide to go about this project.
